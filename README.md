# Wazuh + ART Testing
This project is based on [Wazuh: Emulation of ATT&CK Techniques](https://wazuh.com/blog/emulation-of-attck-techniques-and-detection-with-wazuh/).
I demonstrate the components of basic network configuration and using Wazuh to ingest logs generated from Atomic Red Team Tests. Everything performed was completed on my homelab stack.

## Objective
The main objective is to create custom rules that detect and log attack vectors generated from the Atomic Tests. Other objectives involved understanding sysmon, event viewer, xml configuration files, creating custom rules, and fixing errors or using workarounds when encountering errors.

## Equipment
Edgerouter-x-sfp<br>Cisco Catalyst 2960-C<br>Proxmox Server (PC)<br>Management PC<br>Wazuh Virtual Machine<br>Windows 11 Virtual Machine
